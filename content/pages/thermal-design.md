title: Thermal Design
uid: d51c2ce7-9538-4a50-20ef-88704b6e9faf
---

Thermal design concerns the maintenance of proper temperature, typically within a building, structure, vehicle, or device. We will focus on a convenient and important example, that of buildings such as on the MIT campus. Our emphasis will be that of energy usage due to wintertime space heating; treatments of summertime cooling are in many ways similar.

This unit has the following objectives:

*   To understand basic principles governing heat flow.
*   To learn some types of wall and window construction typical of residential and light commercial building construction as they relate to heat (and also moisture) flow.
*   To understand the basic principles of thermography, the operation of a thermal infrared camera, and the use of thermal IR imaging in evaluating building heat loss.
*   To conduct an engineering study of the thermal performance of an MIT building.

There will be one in-lab practical exercise and an engineering report:

1\. We will carry out a practical laboratory exercise in which we determine the heat flow characteristics of several types of construction. ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/thermal_lab))

2\. Each team will conduct and report on a Heat Loss Study of an MIT building or part thereof. ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/project3))
